A Test Kitchen Driver for Amazon AWS Cloudformation.

This driver uses the [aws sdk gem][aws_sdk_gem] to create and delete Amazon AWS Cloudformation stacks to orchestrate your cloud resources for your infrastructure testing, dev or production setup.

If you wish to use servers specified as a hostname in the converge step then use a AWS VPC where the servers have fixed IP addresses or Elastic IP Addresses.

So you can deploy and test say a Mongodb High Availability cluster by using cloud formation to create the servers
and then converge each of the servers in the cluster and run tests.

This can be used with [kitchen-inspec](https://github.com/chef/kitchen-inspec) or [kitchen-verifier-awspec](https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-verifier-awspec) to do verification of AWS infrastructure.

## Requirements

There are **no** external system requirements for this driver. However you
will need access to an [AWS][aws_site] account.

See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStack.html for parameter details.

### AWS Authentication

In order to connect to AWS, you must specify the AWS access key id and secret key
for your account. There are 3 ways you do this, and we will try them in the
following order:

1. You can specify the access key and access secret (and optionally the session
   token) through config.  The `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`
   parameters can be configured in the .kitchen.yml but its recommended to use
   through environment variables.  If you would like to specify your session token
   use the environment variable `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.
2. The shared credentials ini file at `~/.aws/credentials`. This is the file
   populated by `aws configure` command line and used by AWS tools in general, so if
   you are set up for any other AWS tools, you probably already have this. You can
   specify multiple profiles in this file and select one with the `AWS_PROFILE`
   environment variable or the `shared_credentials_profile` driver config.  Read
   [this][credentials_docs] for more information.
3. From an instance profile when running on EC2.  This accesses the local
   metadata service to discover the local instance's IAM instance profile.

This precedence order is taken from http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html#Configuration

The first method attempted that works will be used.  IE, if you want to auth
using the instance profile, you must not set any of the access key configs
or environment variables, and you must not specify a `~/.aws/credentials`
file.

Because the Test Kitchen test should be checked into source control and ran
through CI we no longer recommend storing the AWS credentials in the
`.kitchen.yml` file.  Instead, specify them as environment variables or in the
`~/.aws/credentials` file.


## SSL Certificate File Issues

On windows you can get errors `SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed`
as per https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/93 .

To overcome this problem set the environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` to a a SSL CA bundle.

A file ca-bundle.crt is supplied inside this gem for this purpose so you can set it to something like:
`<RubyHome>/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/kitchen-cloudformation-0.0.1/ca-bundle.crt`


## Example

See example at https://github.com/neillturner/cloudformation_repo

kitchen create default-test -l debug

Create the stack if it does not exist and creates a change set if one is specified.

kitchen converge default-test -l debug

Executes the change set if one has been created

The following could be used in a `.kitchen.yml` or in a `.kitchen.local.yml`
to override default configuration.

```yaml
